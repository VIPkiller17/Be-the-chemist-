The best way to run the project is get the latest jMonkeyEngine, install Steam, create an account and log-in. In your steam library go to tools and install SteamVR.
In this .zip file there ia a file called steamvr.vrsettings, you will need to put this into the Steam/config folder.
You will then need to go into jMonkeyEngine, click on "Team" at the top, then "git" and then clone. In "repository url" you will need to enter the following link: https://github.com/VIPkiller17/Be-the-chemist- 
and then choose tommy-beta as the branch from which you wish to take the project. In the .zip file there is also a lib folder. Once you have the cloned project
in jMonkeyEngine you will need to right click on the libraries section on the left and choose "Add JAR/Folder" and select all of the libraries in the lib folder.
Then install the latest version of java and everything should work. This has been tested on a 64-bit Windows desktop computer.
